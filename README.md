# Regular = react(ractive) + angular.

Regular help you to build react component in state-driven way, can used in every enviroment;

the current and future web is always component but not data-binding stuff.(angular also is), but component(widget)


in first version regular is aim to replace react's way (jslogic + (jsx or nested function call)) with template to implement react component, then find som difficult probelm to resolve(the rendered's dom structure is assume to have no state, so react use event-proxy to 'avoid');

facebook say "there is no dirty check" but they only have the half perfomance compare to another brother(angular, ractive also regular);


# TODO

1. consistency binding-style (expression and const)
2. component
